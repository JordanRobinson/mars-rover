mars-rover
==========

A very simple mars rover simulation that takes instructions and moves accordingly.

This was done as part of a tech test for a company that I won't name in case they don't want it turning up in searches.

Sadly I ran out of private repos and I didn't want to lose the code, so I've made it public.

Thankfully there seems to be lots of other examples of this particular tech test on the internet, so it should be fine.
