Hi Guys,

This project was put together with Maven, so to run the tests you should be able to just use 

mvn test

to then install and run, you'll need to

mvn install

change directory to the jar, and run the jar.

Hope this is the kind of setup you were expecting.

Thanks,

Jordan.
